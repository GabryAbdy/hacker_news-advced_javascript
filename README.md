# Tongue Hacker News

Tongue Hacker News is a news aggregator which uses the "Hacker News" API by Y Combinator.

## Project description

The application is a vanilla JavaScript project work. It features functions that use the fetch API to retrive the latest news and interact with the DOM to show the first ten. The user can click on the button below the container to see the next ten news and so on.  

The app shows an error message if it can't retrive the news from the API.  

It also shows a message to the user when all the available news are loaded.  

I used Parcel as a bundler due to the relative small scale of the project, to keep it simple and easy.

I did't use any external library or framework, only JavaScript.
